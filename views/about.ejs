  The Notes App is a simple web application built using Node.js, Express.js,
  MongoDB, and Bootstrap. The app allows users to create, view, edit, and delete
  notes. Each note consists of a title and a body. MongoDB is used to store the
  notes data persistently, and Bootstrap is used for front-end styling and
  layout.
